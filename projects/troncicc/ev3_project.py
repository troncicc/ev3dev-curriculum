"""Hello, I'm Michael Scott, regional manager of a mid range paper supply company. The goal of this game
is to help Michael avoid his duties and gain enough happy points so he can survive his encounter with
Jan. (need 500 happy points)

Timer:

Calibration!: Michael's office
Auto drive/beacon: Baler
2: Jim
3: Dwight
4: Kelly
5: Pam
6:

Kelly/Ryan:
   (if time > 12)
     You have become trapped by Kelly's endless conversation about how much she loves Ryan and wants to have his
     babies. Back away SLOWLY so she doesn't notice that you're gone.
     if speed > NUM:
     (success = happy + 100)
     (failure = happy - 100)
     (time goes forward quickly... soon, an hour is gone)

Toby:
     Oh no! You have been spotted by Toby! You can either run away quickly or attempt to kill him by
     picking him up and putting him in the baler. If you succeed, you will gain 500 happy points.
     But be careful... If you miss, you will be subject to a counseling session and you will die of boredom.
     (success = happy + 500)
     (failure = cause of death: boredom)

Dwight:
     sound (Dwight: 'MICHAEL!!!')
     You hear that?? That's the sound of Dwight being a baby again. Hide in your office motionless
     until he goes away. If he sees you, he will stare in your window until you come out.
     (success = happy + 100)
     (failure = happy - 100)
     (time goes forward quickly... soon, an hour is gone)

Jimbo, Jim, Jimothy:
     You spot Jim from across the room.

Creed:
    You are disgusted by his old man smell
    (failure = happy - 100)

Pam:
    You walk over to reception and do an impression that nobody understands.
